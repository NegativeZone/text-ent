# text-ent
REST Server using Async Python 3 for Textual Entailment. This project is being developed as an assignment.

## Overview

This project uses an aiohttp asynchronous server framework for python and asyncio to host a TensorFlow based neural network that performs textual entailment analysis on two string inputs.

## Current State of the Project

Async server and Neural Network are independently functional. Currently working on separating the training and testing phases of the model. Then will add on the server configurations.
